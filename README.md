# A0_Projects
My first Git-tracked projects
I'm a noob to GitHub, so first commits are a bit messy
The first test upload is a Python script that creates a blank Word docuemnt
And then asks user to copy data blocks to clipboard followed by VBA-driven pastes of them into the Word doc
Until the users types xx --that terminates the loop
