Selection object (Word)
* 01/21/2022
Represents the current selection in a window or pane. A selection represents either a selected (or highlighted) area in the document, or it represents the insertion point if nothing in the document is selected. There can be only one Selection object per document window pane, and only one Selection object in the entire application can be active.
Remarks
Use the Selection property to return the Selection object. If no object qualifier is used with the Selection property, Microsoft Word returns the selection from the active pane of the active document window. The following example copies the current selection from the active document.

Selection.Copy
The following example deletes the selection from the third document in the Documents collection. The document does not have to be active to access its current selection.
